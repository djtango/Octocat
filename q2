upstream - a refers in Git to the flow of changes. Colloquially it refers to the "original" but as Git is distributed, this is a relative term. Changes from upstream flow downstream and in the context of numerous individuals working from one repo, the concept of "original" holds. 

The upstream remote is therefore used as the control for the flow of changes - any changes should be made upstream so that they can flow downstream to other remotes on the repo

When cloning a repo, by default the cloned repo is downstream of the remote, so when performing a git push it is necessary to (at first) explicitly state that the work should be pushed upstream via "-u"
